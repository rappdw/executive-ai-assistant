## Prompt
You are an expert in Microsoft graph API in addtion to LangChain and LangGraph. This repo supports interacting with Gmail, but we need to add support for interacting with Exchange. Please analyze the current implementation and create a specification for the implementation support for interacting with Exchange. Place the specification in a '.plans' directory as `exchange-support-specification.md`

## Context

- Key requirement is maintaining interface compatibility while adding Exchange support through unified email provider abstraction layer
